# ONNX-ImageNet-1K-Object-Detector
Python scripts for performing object detection with the 1000 labels of the ImageNet dataset in ONNX. The repository combines a class agnostic object localizer to first detect the objects in the image and the label of each box is obtained using a ResNet50 model trained on the ImageNet dataset.
